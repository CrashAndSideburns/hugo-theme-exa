# hugo-theme-exa

If you would like to use this theme, it can be easily added to any Hugo site, ideally as a git submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/CrashAndSideburns/hugo-theme-exa.git themes
```

That being said, this theme is designed for my personal use, so a lot of things that should not be hard-coded are, meaning that anyone wanting to use this theme will probably have to modify it somewhat before using it. Furthermore, I would much rather people fashion their personal websites after their own tastes and preferences, rather than deferring to someone else's. This repository is all Unlicensed, so please feel free to take inspiration from anything that you see, and copy as you please. My only hope is that this may provide inspiration to someone looking to create their own unique corner of the web.
